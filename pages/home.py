            <h2>Welcome to app_v2!<br/>Omdena's Crisis Forecasting Tool Project for ACAPS</h2>
            <p>This project aims to develop a custom workflow that leverages AI-powered tools to gather real-time data on crisis triggers. By utilizing data from multiple sources such as Twitter, Google Trends, and news websites, we categorize public sentiment and provide actionable insights for data analysts and policymakers in various countries. Our goal is to offer precise, real-time information to support informed decision-making to predict crisis situations.</p>

        <h4>New Features in app_v2! ðŸ¤©</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sophie</strong> is now available in more than 20 languages. To change language, please scroll down.</li>
            <li><strong>Sophie</strong> can now reply with voice for short messages, in <em>all</em> those 20+ languages. To toggle voice mode on or off, please scroll down.</li>
            <li>A brand new <strong>ACLED Data Explorer page</strong>, where you can browse through ACLED's data and also get advanced AI-based summaries and key points.</li>
            <li><strong>ACLED Data has been integrated</strong> with Sophie, so she can perform analysis on country-specific ACLED Data as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Completely revamped query routing mechanism</strong> for Sophie so she can better detect what you are asking for and respond accordingly with facts and data.</li>
            <li><strong>GDELT and Twitter agents</strong> in the chat system are also <strong>fully functional</strong> for the country of Ukraine. Support for more countries will be added in the future, due to restrictions in the usage of their API.</li>
            <li><strong>Sophie can now remember country-specific inquiry responses</strong> of all agents as context, to give you better replies in a conversation. In v1, Sophie only remembered the summary that was displayed to you, the user.</li>

            <h3>Impact on Analysis and Decision Making</h3>
            <p>The slow pace and potential inaccuracies of manual sentiment analysis have significant implications for political analysis and decision-making in regions experiencing political, economic, and social unrest. Delays in obtaining real-time information hinder analysts and policymakers from proactively responding to public sentiment, leading to missed opportunities for engagement or intervention. Furthermore, inaccuracies in manual analysis can result in poorly informed strategies that not only fail to achieve objectives but also exacerbate public dissatisfaction and distrust, affecting political stability and undermining the democratic process.</p>
